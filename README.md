# CSS487Project - EmotifilterFX

Welcome to **EmotifilterFX**, our computer vision class project. This application is designed to detect facial features and overlay corresponding emotional filters in real-time. Using simple facial recognition technology, we've developed a way to add a bit of fun to your online interactions by applying filters that reflect different emotions.

## How It Works

**Here's a simple breakdown of the application's functionality:**

- **Face Detection**: Through the camera, the software identifies your face in real-time.
- **Expression Analysis**: The software analyzes your facial expressions.
- **Filter Application**: Depending on your expression, a specific filter (like a teardrop or rainbow) is overlaid onto your face in the video feed.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: You can see the applied filters instantly as your expression changes.

## Getting Started

**To try out EmotifilterFX:**

- Clone the project or download the source code
- Install the [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) compiler and [Opencv](https://opencv.org/)
